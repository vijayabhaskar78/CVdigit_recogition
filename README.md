This project is a foundational implementation of a digit recognition system, focusing on the identification of handwritten digits from images. Using computer vision techniques, it processes images of digits and utilizes machine learning algorithms to classify them accurately. The project serves as an excellent entry point for those new to the field of computer vision, providing hands-on experience with image data and machine learning workflows.

The system works by first preprocessing the image data, which includes steps like image resizing, grayscale conversion, and thresholding to enhance digit features. Once the images are prepared, a machine learning model, often a simple algorithm like a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier or a neural network, is trained to recognize the patterns in the digits.

This digit recognition project not only demonstrates the capabilities of image processing but also provides practical insights into machine learning models' ability to learn from visual data. It is an ideal way to start exploring more complex topics in computer vision and machine learning.
